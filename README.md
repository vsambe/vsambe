Hi, I'm Viktoria
coming from Austria and currently living in Germany

I'm interested in Sustainability topics ðŸŒ±, especially in Sustainable Finance but also in Big Data and AI as I am convinced that these tools will
supercharge our sustainability efforts. I have experience as an Impact Evaluator in the Impact Finance Industry, where I have evaluated the 
positive impact of projects that were financed by Development Finance Institutions. I have evaluated two impact funds in Sub-Saharan Africa and
one bank in Eastern Europe according to the OECD DAC criteria. One part of this evaluation process what checking out the project's Impact Measurement
and Monitoring system which means looking at the collection, methodology and analysation of all necessary data to assess relevant environmental, social,
and economic impacts (similar to ESG) according to their Theory of Change. In other words, this is the sweet spot where we are talking about Big Data 
and potentially AI. 

Thus, I am working towards being able to create my own AI models to measure and evaluate sustainability related impacts/achievements. 

I have also experience in the Executive Search industry, where I "headhunted" ðŸ‘€ potential candidates for C-Level and Board of Directors positions within
big Multinational Corporations worldwide. 

Personally, I am obsessed with my dog. In fact, she is a special dog in a wheelchair but we are still able to go hiking and swimming and Stand-Up-Paddling which
is incredible and a lot of fun.ðŸ˜„
